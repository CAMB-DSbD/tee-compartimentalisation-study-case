# A use-case for attestable evaluation
=======

We are interested in evaluating two attestable properties:  
 
- the operation of the cloud-based attestation procedure discussed in - [attestablelauncher](https://github.com/CAMB-DSbD/attestablelauncher "repository")


- some performance properties of the attestbables created
on a Morello Board with the assistance of the library
compartmentalisation tool.


To this end, we have implemented an Enterprise Application Integration 
(EAI) also called Integration Solution that operates as follows:

  
  This repository contains the implementation of a study case to demonstrate how to run an integration process inside a trusted execution environment (TEE) using a Morello Board experimental hardware located in Canada. Basically, this case study implements three mock digital services (apps) that run in distinct remore servers in Brazil and an integration process (program) written and compiled for cheri-caps that runs inside a single compartment. The integration process compilation and execution is managed by a laucher program that runs outside the trusted execution environment but still inside the Morello Board operating system. In this case study, our integration process program acts as a client by invoking the remote servers represented by the digital services apps.

# Description  

1) App-Store, App-Transport and App-Whatsapp
- Each of these directories contains an API (API1.py, API2.py, API3.py), a database (compras.db, transport_app.db), and a key pair (cert.pem, priv.pem).
- The APIs are responsible for providing specific endpoints:
 - API1.py (App-Store): Provides the /api/sales endpoint to check the last sale.
 - API2.py (App-Transport): Provides the /api/trips endpoint to book a trip.
 - API3.py (App-Whatsapp): Provides the /send-message endpoint to send a confirmation message via WhatsApp.
   
2) Launcher
- launcher.py: A server that manages the upload, compilation and execution of programs inside a TEE at compartments. It runs on the operating system outside the TEE and handles upload requests, compiles the C code (integration_process.c) written with cheri-caps, and allows the generated binary code to be executed inside a single compartment. It also creates and store the required certificates locally outside the TEE on the operating system.
- command-line-interface.py: A command line client interface (CLI) for interacting with the server (launcher.py), allowing to list files, upload, delete, compile and run programs.
- generate_certificate.py: Generates the certificates and keys for the integration_process executable binary code. It includes information such as CPU model, number of CPUs, memory addresses, hash of the executable binary code and its signature to the certificate.
- Programs and Data:
 - programs-data-base/sources: Contains the program source codes written in C language (e.g. integration_process.c).
 - programs-data-base/cheri-caps-executables: Contains the executable binary codes generated for cheri-caps.
 - programs-data-base/certificates: Contains the attestables and the keys generated for the execution environment of each executable binary code.
 - attestable-data/signatures: Contains the signatures of the executable binary codes.

   
# Execution sequence

1) Launcher initialisation
 - The launcher is started by running launcher.py.
 - The launcher is ready to receive requests to upload, compile and run programmes.
2) Code upload
 - The CLI (command-line-interface.py) is used to upload a C program (ex. integration_process.c) to the Morello Board Environment.
 - The launcher saves the uploaded file in the programs-data-base/sources folder and updates the file_database.json.
3) Code compilation
 - The request to compile the source code is made via the CLI.
 - The launcher compiles the source code for cheri caps and saves the executable binary code in folder programs-data-base/cheri-caps-executables.
 - A corresponding certificate directory is created inside the folder programs-data-base/certificates.
4) Code execution
 - The compiled binary code is executed via the CLI.
 - The launcher executes the binary and returns the output.
5) Certificate generation
 - During execution, the integration_process.c calls the generate_certificate.py located inside folder attestable-data.
 - The generate_certificate.py script generates the corresponding keys and certificates for the running executable binary code, including information such as CPU model, number of CPUs, and memory addresses.
6) Interaction with External APIs
 - The integration_process.c makes HTTPS calls to the defined APIs (API1_URL, API2_URL, API3_URL), using OpenSSL to check sales, book trips and send confirmation messages via WhatsApp.
